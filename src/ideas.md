# ideas for further improvement
 * basic OO tutorial
 * tutorial on properties
 * replace pandemics with something else?
     * eppstein civil violence 1 / 2
     * cultural difusion
 * forest fire as an other easy one
 * use of tutorials next to assignments (a la EPA1361)
 * mimic exam style better in assignments
     * either stick with debug, or move to implement parts of a model
